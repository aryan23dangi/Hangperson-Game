The following are a brief descriptions of what each file in the program does:
1. Main.cpp: The program randomly selects a word from a file and displays a series of asterisks to represent the letters of the word. The player is then prompted to guess a letter, and if the letter is present in the word, the corresponding asterisk is replaced by the letter. If the letter is not present, the player receives a strike, and a part of the hangperson is drawn on the screen. The game continues until the player has guessed the word or run out of guesses.The program keeps track of the letters guessed so far and displays them to the user. If the player successfully guesses the word, the program displays a congratulatory message. If not, the program displays a message indicating that the player has lost and reveals the word.The program also includes a "restart" option that allows the player to play another game with a new randomly selected word. Finally, the program records the game results and appends them to a text file for future reference.
2. selectWord.cpp: This is a function that selects a random word from a text file named "words_EC.txt". The function uses the standard libraries iostream and fstream to read from the file and ctime to seed the random number generator with the current time. The function begins by opening the file using the ifstream object inFile. It then reads each line of the file into a string variable word and stores it in an array arr_word. After all lines have been read, the function returns a random element from the array using the rand() function to generate a random index. The returned word will be used as the word to be guessed in the Hangperson game.
3. gameInput.cpp: This function takes user input and returns a lowercase string of length 1 representing the guessed letter. It first prompts the user to guess a letter, then reads in the input using cin. The input is then converted to lowercase and stored in a string y of length 1, which is returned.
4. display.cpp: The function display takes in three parameters: count, an integer representing the number of incorrect guesses the player has made so far; pred_word, an array of strings representing the letters guessed correctly so far (with "_" representing the letters not yet guessed); and size, an integer representing the length of the word being guessed.he function first checks the value of count and prints out the corresponding ASCII art of the hangperson. Then, it prints out the pred_word array with spaces between each element, followed by a line of underscores representing the letters not yet guessed.
Overall, the display function is responsible for displaying the current state of the game to the player.
5. recordResults.cpp: his function recordResults takes a string all_data as input and writes it to a file named results_EC.txt in the specified directory using ofstream. It then closes the file.
6. hangPerson.h: It is a header file that contains function declarations, class definitions, and other declarations that are meant to be shared across multiple files.
